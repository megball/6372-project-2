<h1>MSDS 6372 Project 2 Description</h1>

There are two main objectives for Project 2.  

<h3>Objective 1: Display the ability to perform EDA and build a logistic regression model.</h3>

•	Perform your logistic regression analysis and provide interpretation of the regression coefficients including hypothesis testing, and confidence intervals. For simplicity sake, you do not need to include interactions with this model. Comment on the  practical vs statistical significance of the deemed important factors.


Logistical Considerations

•	Just like last time, this does not have to be extremely fancy in terms of the model building approach, let EDA, feature selection, and overall intuition guide you.

•	If you feel like interactions are absolutely necessary to capture what is going on, then contact me so we can discuss an overall strategy of how to provide interpretations.


<h3>Objective 2:  With a simple logistic regression model as a baseline, perform additional competing models to improve on prediction performance metrics.  Which metrics are up to you and your given data set.</h3>

•	Record the predictive performance metrics from your simple, highly interpretable model from Objective 1.


•	You must include one additional logistic regression model which is also a more complicated logistic regression model than in Objective 1.  By complicated, I do not mean that you include more predictors (that will be somewhat sorted out in Objective 1), but rather model complexity through interaction terms, new variables created by the group, transformations or additions through polynomials.

•	Create another competing model using just the continuous predictors and use LDA or QDA.  

•	(Optional) Use a nonparameteric model approach as a competing model.  Random forest or decision tree for predictors that are both categorical and continuous or a k-nearest neighbors approach if just working with continuous predictors. 

•	Provide a summary table of the performance across the competing methods. Summarize the overall findings.  A really great report will also give insight as to why the “best” model won out.  This is where a thorough EDA will always help.
